# FairShare - Expense Sharing Calculator

A simple and elegant web application for calculating fair expense sharing between partners based on income proportions.

## Overview

FairShare helps couples or partners split expenses fairly by calculating proportional contributions based on each person's income. This ensures both parties contribute the same percentage of their income to shared expenses.

## Features

- Calculate fair expense shares based on salary inputs
- Real-time calculation updates
- Dark theme with modern UI
- Mobile-responsive design
- No dependencies - pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How It Works

1. Enter the total expense amount
2. Input both partners' monthly salaries
3. The calculator automatically determines:
   - Each person's fair share percentage
   - The exact amount each should contribute
   - Reimbursement amounts depending on who pays

## Example

If you earn €1500/month and your partner earns €1100/month:
- Your share: 57.69% of any expense
- Partner's share: 42.31% of any expense

For a €100 expense:
- You pay: €57.69
- Partner pays: €42.31
